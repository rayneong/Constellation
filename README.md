# Matrix
The Matrix is an arcade game machine on which users can play some classic arcade games.
Final Project for DES INV 23 (Spring 2018)

## Summary
The Matrix is made up of two major components - a display and controls.

Our goal is to create an intuitive scalable open-source graphics library for Arduino Matrix LEDs, inspired by the p5 language, and to code an interactive 2D game using our library. Other groups will be able to use components built into the library.

## Components
- Matrix LEDs (32x32)
- Adafruit/Arduino Board
- Controls (Potentiometers/Buttons/etc)

## Challenges
Finding appropriate components as controls can be hard. Designing and implementing intuitive functions will be challenging and potentially frustrating to debug. The complexity of game logic will be dependant on the game being implemented.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Finish proposal, complete rough game design, outline graphics library components
- Week 2: Acquire hardware components, begin to build library
- Week 3: Debug and unleash first deliverable library prototypes, build game prototype
- Week 4: Integrate user feedback, make necessary adjustments to library, polish game prototype
- Week 5: Present complete project.

# Constellation
## Laser-Based Interactive Musical Instrument
We propose to build a laser-based interactive musical instrument: a device that allows users to play different sounds through the interaction with a series of laser rays.

## Summary
The device is made up of two parts: (1) a series of buzzers surrounding (2) a central rectangular control box. Each buzzer is mounted on top of a post and is connected to the box in the center. The box consists of a number of laser diodes and an equal number of photoresistors. The diodes are placed on one side of the box and emit laser to the photoresistors that are on the other side of the box. The Feather Board reads the resistance and changes the sound (frequency, pitch, interval, etc.) of the buzzers accordingly.

## Components
Component parts
Hardware:
Buzzers 
Laser diodes 
Photoresistors

## Software
Program that detects the change in resistance and adjust the sound of the buzzers

## Challenges
Since we have spent half of our time on ideating, we have limited amount of time to implement our idea. 
Assembling unfamiliar components can be difficult.
Integrating all components together can be messy and time-consuming.

## Timeline
Week 1: (passed) Ideation.
Week 2: (passed) Ideation.
Week 3: Build the instrument. Order components as needed. Finish most of the hardware. 
Week 4: Write the control program. Integrate all components. Polish the design.
Week 5: Final adjustments. Presentation.
