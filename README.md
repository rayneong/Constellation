# Matrix
Final Project for DES INV 23 (Spring 2018)

## Summary
Our goal is to create an intuitive scalable open-source graphics library for Arduino Matrix LEDs, inspired by the p5 language, and to code an interactive 2D game using our library. Other groups will be able to use components built into the library.

## Components
- Matrix LEDs
- Adafruit/Ardunio Board
- Controls (Potentiometers/Buttons/etc)

## Challenges
Designing and implementing intuitive functions will be challenging and potentially frustrating to debug. The complexity of game logic will be dependant on the game being implemented.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Finish proposal, complete rough game design, outline graphics library components
- Week 2: Acquire hardware components, begin to build library
- Week 3: Debug and unleash first deliverable library prototypes, build game prototype
- Week 4: Integrate user feedback, make necessary adjustments to library, polish game prototype
- Week 5: Present complete project.
