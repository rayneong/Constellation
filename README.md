## Laser-Based Interactive Musical Instrument
We propose to build a laser-based interactive musical instrument: a device that allows users to play different sounds through the interaction with a series of laser rays.

## Summary
The device is made up of two parts: (1) a series of buzzers surrounding (2) a central rectangular control box. Each buzzer is mounted on top of a post and is connected to the box in the center. The box consists of a number of laser diodes and an equal number of photoresistors. The diodes are placed on one side of the box and emit laser to the photoresistors that are on the other side of the box. The Feather Board reads the resistance and changes the sound (frequency, pitch, interval, etc.) of the buzzers accordingly.

## Components
Component parts
Hardware:
Buzzers 
Laser diodes 
Photoresistors

## Software
Program that detects the change in resistance and adjust the sound of the buzzers

## Challenges
Since we have spent half of our time on ideating, we have limited amount of time to implement our idea. 
Assembling unfamiliar components can be difficult.
Integrating all components together can be messy and time-consuming.

## Timeline
- Week 1: (passed) Ideation.
- Week 2: (passed) Ideation.
- Week 3: Build the instrument. Order components as needed. Finish most of the hardware. 
- Week 4: Write the control program. Integrate all components. Polish the design.
- Week 5: Final adjustments. Presentation.
